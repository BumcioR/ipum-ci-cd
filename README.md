Deployment & CI/CD

This exercise focuses on the continuous integration (CI) and continous delivery (CD)
pipelines for deployment of ML models, as well as optimization of models for
inference after training. Those operations allow safe, automated and efficient
updates of models to production environment.

GitHub Actions for CI pipelines will be used due to their simplicity and popularity.
For model compilation and optimization, ONNX tools will be used to convert our models
to a versatile and efficient format.
